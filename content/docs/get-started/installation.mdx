description: 'Learn how to install the open-source Netdata Agent on any physical or virtual system to start monitoring the availability and performance of systems, services, and applications.'
---

Netdata runs permanently on all your physical/virtual servers, containers, cloud deployments, and edge/IoT devices. It
runs on Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, and more), container/microservice platforms (Kubernetes clusters,
Docker), and many other operating systems (FreeBSD, macOS), with no `sudo` required.

The **recommended** way to install the Netdata Agent on a Linux system is our [one-line kickstart
script](/docs/installation/kickstart.mdx), which automatically installs dependencies and builds Netdata from source.

Copy the script, paste it into your node's terminal, and hit `Enter`.

<OneLineInstall />

```bash
bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh)
```

## Other operating systems and methods

platform to see specific instructions.

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues with installing the Netdata Agent, see our
[installation](/docs/agent/packaging/installer#troubleshooting-and-known-issues) reference. Our
[reinstall](/docs/agent/packaging/installer/reinstall) doc can help clean up your installation and get you back to
monitoring.

## What's next?

At this point, you have set up your free Netdata Cloud account, installed the Netdata Agent on your node(s), and claimed
one or more nodes to your Space. You're ready to start monitoring, visualizing, and troubleshooting with Netdata. We
have two quickstart guides based on the scope of what you need to monitor.

Interested in monitoring a single node? Check out our [single-node monitoring
quickstart](/docs/quickstart/single-node).

If you're looking to monitor an entire infrastructure with Netdata, see the [infrastructure monitoring
quickstart](/docs/quickstart/infrastructure).

Or, skip ahead to [Agent configuration](/docs/configure/nodes).
