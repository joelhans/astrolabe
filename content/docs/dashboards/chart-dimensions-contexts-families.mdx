# Chart dimensions, contexts, and families

While Netdata's charts require no configuration and are [easy to interact with](/docs/dashboards/interact-charts.mdx),
they have a lot of underlying complexity. To meaningfully organize charts out of the box based on what's happening in
your nodes, Netdata uses the concepts of **dimensions**, **contexts**, and **families**.

Understanding how these work will help you more easily navigate the dashboard, [write new
alarms](/docs/monitor/configure-alars.md), or play around with the [API](/web/api/README.md).

For a refresher on the anatomy of a chart, see [dashboards and charts](/docs/dashboards/dashboards-charts.mdx).

## Dimensions

A **dimension** is a value that gets shown on a chart. The value can be raw data or calculated values, such as
percentages, aggregates, and more.

Beneath every chart (or on the right-side if you [configure the
dashboard](/docs/dashboards/customize.mdx#change-chart-legend-position)) is a legend of dimensions. When there are
multiple dimensions, you'll see a different entry in the legend for each dimension.

The **Apps CPU Time** chart (with the [context](#contexts) `apps.cpu`), which visualizes CPU utilization of
different types of processes/services/applications on your node, always provides a vibrant example of a chart with
multiple dimensions.

![An example apps.cpu chart with many
dimensions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/114207816-a5cb7400-9911-11eb-8800-06f60b745f9c.png)

The chart shows 13 unique dimensions, such as `httpd` for the CPU utilization for web servers, `kernel` for anything
related to the Linux kernel, and so on. In your dashboard, these specific dimensions will almost certainly be different.

Dimensions can be [hidden](/docs/dashboards/interact-charts.mdx#show-and-hide-dimensions) to help you focus your
attention.

## Contexts

A **context** is a way of grouping charts by the types of metrics collected and dimensions displayed. It's kind of like
a machine-readable naming and organization scheme.

For example, the **Apps CPU Time** has the context `apps.cpu`. A little further down on the dashboard is a similar
chart, **Apps Real Memory (w/o shared)** with the context `apps.mem`. Because these two charts share the `apps.` portion
of their context, they're grouped together into the **Applications** section on the dashboard.

Netdata also uses contexts for [alarm configuration](/docs/monitor/configure-alarms.md) (the [`on`
line](/health/REFERENCE.md#alarm-line-on)).

## Families

**Families** are a _single instance_ of a hardware or software resource that needs to be displayed separately from
similar instances.

For example, let's look at the **Disks** section, which contains a number of charts with contexts like `disk.io`,
`disk.ops`, `disk.backlog`, and `disk.util`. If your node has multiple disk drives at `sda` and `sdb`, Netdata creates
a separate family for each.

Netdata now merges the contexts and families to create charts that are grouped by family, following a
`[context].[family]` naming scheme, so that you can see the `disk.io` and `disk.ops` charts for `sda` right next to each
other.

Given the four example contexts, and two families of `sda` and `sdb`, Netdata will create the following charts and their
names:

| Context        | `sda` family       | `sdb` family       |
| :------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| `disk.io`      | `disk_io.sda`      | `disk_io.sdb`      |
| `disk.ops`     | `disk_ops.sda`     | `disk_ops.sdb`     |
| `disk.backlog` | `disk_backlog.sda` | `disk_backlog.sdb` |
| `disk.util`    | `disk_util.sda`    | `disk_util.sdb`    |

## What's next?

With an understanding of a chart's dimensions, context, and family, you're now ready to dig even deeper into Netdata's
dashboard. We recommend looking into [using the time & date picker](/docs/dashboards/pick-timeframes.mdx), but you can
also skip ahead to [customization](/docs/dashboards/customize.mdx).

If you feel familiar enough with navigating the dashboard, a good next step is [data
collection](/docs/collect/how-collectors-work.mdx), which will help you see new metrics on Netdata's dashboard based on
the running services/applications.
