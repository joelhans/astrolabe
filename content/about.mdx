**For fun, I write fiction and other oddities in prose.**

Some of those works have been featured in _West Branch_, _No Tokens_, _Puerto del Sol_, _Booth: A Journal_, _The Adroit
Journal_, _The Masters Review_, _Caketrain_, and others. I maintain a [list](/fiction) of all these publications if
you'd like to take a look.

I received my MFA in creative writing from the University of Arizona in 2016 and served as the prose &amp; managing
editor of [*Fairy Tale Review*](https://fairytalereview.com) from 2014 to 2018.

I'm currently working on a novel about mythology, fatherhood, constellations, light pollution, and the lengths to which
we might go to rewrite our own stories.

My work was listed as an honorable mention in the *Caketrain* Competition and the Madeline P. Plonsker Emerging Writers
Residency Prize judged by Brian Evenson, nominated for the Pushcart Prize and Best of the Net, and the recipient of the
University of Arizona Foundation Award.

**I'm also a copywriter and strategic consultant for tech companies via the business I started in 2021: [Commit
Copy](https://commitcopy.com).**

I started copywriting back in 2016. After that, I was recruited to lead technical marketing, documentation, and
developer education at Netdata, a startup building more democratic infrastructure monitoring software. I stayed there
for two years before decided to return to consulting work.

Since relaunching my copywriting and consulting business, I've worked with clients like IBM, Red Hat, CNCF, Autodesk,
and more.

**Writing isn't my only interest.**

I spend time with my daughters, mountain bike, play guitar, do calisthenics, and walk around my backyard barefoot.
There's also running, web development, gardening, and a few other interests&mdash;hopefully [write about](/articles/)
each of them someday.
