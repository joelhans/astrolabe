I'm a writer living in Tucson, Arizona with my wife and two daughters.

My short stories have been featured in _No Tokens_, _West Branch_, _Puerto del Sol_, _Booth: A Journal_, _The Adroit
Journal_, _The Masters Review_, _Caketrain_, and others. Read these, and others, 

I received my MFA in creative writing from the University of Arizona in 2016 and served as the prose &amp; managing
editor of [*Fairy Tale Review*](https://fairytalereview.com) from 2014 to 2018.

I'm currently working on a novel about mythology, fatherhood, constellations, light pollution, and the lengths to which
we might go to rewrite our own stories.

My work was listed as an honorable mention in the *Caketrain* Competition and the Madeline P. Plonsker Emerging Writers
Residency Prize judged by Brian Evenson, nominated for the Pushcart Prize and Best of the Net, and the recipient of the
University of Arizona Foundation Award.

I've been a full-time freelance copywriter on-and-off since 2016, with a few multi-year stints at tech startups. As a
freelancer, I'm proud to have worked with some big tech/software/IT clients like IBM, Red Hat, Johnson & Johnson, and
Autodesk.

In November 2021, I launched a new copywriting business focused on B2B tech and open-source companies: [Commit
Copy](https://commitcopy.com).

I have a lot of other hobbies and interests, like mountain biking, running, guitar, web development, creating adventures
for my children, React/MDX, calisthenics, gardening, and walking around in my backyard barefoot. I'll certainly [write
about](/articles/) each of them someday.
