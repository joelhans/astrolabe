title: About
summary: "I'm an author and copywriter living in Tucson, Arizona."
---

My stories have been featured in _No Tokens_, _West Branch_, _Puerto del Sol_, _Booth: A Journal_, _The Adroit Journal_,
_The Masters Review_, _Caketrain_, and others. My work has been nominated for the Pushcart Prize and Best of the Net,
and was the recipient of the University of Arizona Foundation Award. I received my MFA in creative writing from the
University of Arizona.

I'm currently working on a novel about constellations, light pollution, and where things go when they're truly
forgotten.

I live in Tucson, Arizona with my wife and two daughters, who have already mastered the art of tinkering with my heart.

My writerly disguises include copywriting and technical writing for [Nurse Media](https://nurse.media), the consultancy
I started in 2016. Since then, I've done work for tech/software clients like IBM, Red Hat, and Autodesk.
