I'm equal parts prose and code.

I share my experiences on educating developers through the intersection between documentation, technical writing, and
development via a smattering of [articles](/articles).

Right now I work at [Netdata](https://netdata.cloud), a monitoring startup for granular, real-time metrics on any
system. I do a little bit of everything there, like improving the developer experience via documentation and educational
content, developming React components, and promoting new features. Before that, I launched a growth-centric copywriting
consultancy called [Nurse Media](https://nurse.media). After a few years, I landed some fantastic clients like IBM, Red
Hat, and Autodesk.

I [write fiction](/fiction), mostly short stories, although I'm at work on a novel about light pollution,
constellations, and forgetting.
