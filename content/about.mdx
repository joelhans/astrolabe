summary: "I'm Joel Hans, a fiction writer with a few other disguises."
---

I've published short fiction in a handful of literary journals, like _No Tokens_, _West Branch_, _Puerto del Sol_,
_Booth: A Journal_, _The Adroit Journal_, _The Masters Review_, and others. In what feels like another life, I was the
managing editor of [_Fairy Tale Review_](https://fairytalereview.com) while I was getting my MFA from the University of
Arizona.

My current project is a novel about constellations, light pollution, and where things go when they're truly forgotten.

I live in Tucson, Arizona with my wife and two daughters, who, while young, have already mastered the art of tinkering
with my heart.

My writerly disguises include copywriting and technical writing for [Nurse Media](https://nurse.media), the consultancy
I started in 2016. Since then, I've done work for tech/software clients like IBM, Red Hat, and Autodesk.

And while that's fun, I'm really interested in developing tools to make writing on the web better. More on that soon.

I share my experiences with these disguises via a smattering of [articles](/articles).
