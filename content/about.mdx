I'm a writer living in Tucson, Arizona with my wife and two daughters.

My short stories have been featured in _No Tokens_, _West Branch_, _Puerto del Sol_, _Booth: A Journal_, _The Adroit
Journal_, _The Masters Review_, _Caketrain_, and others. My work has been nominated for the Pushcart Prize and Best of
the Net, and was the recipient of the University of Arizona Foundation Award. I received my MFA in creative writing from
the University of Arizona.

I'm currently working on a novel about constellations, light pollution, and where things go when they're truly
forgotten.

I've been a full-time freelance copywriter on-and-off since 2016, with a few multi-year stints at tech startups. As a
freelancer, I'm proud to have worked with some big tech/software/IT clients like IBM, Red Hat, Johnson & Johnson, and
Autodesk.

In November 2021, I launched a new copywriting business for open-source companies: [**Commit
Copy**](https://commitcopy.com). I'm really excited to work with people who care about the open-source ecosystem, aren't
"FauxSS," and want to build future-enriching products with transparency.

&#10031;

I have a lot of other hobbies and interests, like mountain biking, running, guitar, web development, creating adventures
for my children, web development, React/MDX, calisthenics, gardening, and walking around in my backyard barefoot. I'll
certainly [write about](/articles/) each of them someday.
