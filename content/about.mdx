I'm at the intersection between creative writing, copywriting, and technical writing.

I share my experiences of this intersection, with a little bit of development mixed in, via a smattering of
[articles](/articles).

I'm currently working at my copywriting and content consultancy, [Nurse Media](https://nurse.media). Since I started in
2016, I've worked with some fantastic tech/software clients like IBM, Red Hat, and Autodesk. I'm really excited to build
new relationships and grow the business even more.

I took a two-year hiatus from Nurse to work for [Netdata](https://netdata.cloud), a monitoring startup for granular,
real-time metrics on any system. I did a little bit of everything there, like improving the developer experience via
documentation and educational content, developing React components, and promoting new features.

I [write fiction](/fiction), mostly short stories, although I'm at work on a novel about light pollution,
constellations, and forgetting.
