I'm a writer in Tucson, Arizona.

&#10031;

**For fun, I write fiction and other oddities in prose.**

Some of those works have been featured in _West Branch_, _No Tokens_, _Puerto del Sol_, _Booth: A Journal_, _The Adroit
Journal_, _The Masters Review_, _Caketrain_, and others.

I received my MFA in creative writing from the University of Arizona in 2016 and served as the prose &amp; managing
editor of [*Fairy Tale Review*](https://fairytalereview.com) from 2014 to 2018.

I'm currently working on a novel about mythology, fatherhood, constellations, light pollution, and the lengths to which
we might go to rewrite our own stories.

My work was listed as an honorable mention in the *Caketrain* Competition and the Madeline P. Plonsker Emerging Writers
Residency Prize judged by Brian Evenson, nominated for the Pushcart Prize and Best of the Net, and the recipient of the
University of Arizona Foundation Award.

**I'm also a copywriter and strategic consultant for tech companies via the business I started in 2021: [Commit
Copy](https://commitcopy.com).**

After that, I was recruited to lead technical marketing, documentation, and developer education at Netdata, a startup
building more democratic infrastructure monitoring software. I stayed there for two years before decided to return to
consulting work.

I've been a full-time freelance copywriter on-and-off since 2016, with a few multi-year stints at tech startups. As a
freelancer, I'm proud to have worked with some big tech/software/IT clients like IBM, Red Hat, Johnson & Johnson, and
Autodesk.

**Writing isn't my only interest.**

I have a lot of other hobbies and interests, like mountain biking, running, playing guitar, web development, creating
adventures for my children, React/MDX, calisthenics, gardening, and walking around in my backyard barefoot. I'll
certainly [write about](/articles/) each of them someday.
