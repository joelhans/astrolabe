I'm equal parts prose and code.

I share my experiences on educating developers through the intersection between documentation, technical writing, and
development via a smattering of [posts](/posts).

Right now I work at [Netdata](https://netdata.cloud), a monitoring startup for granular, real-time metris on any system.
I do a little bit of everything there, like improving the developer experience via documentation, coding up React
components, and promoting new features. Before that, I launched a growth-centric copywriting consultancy called [Nurse
Media](https://nurse.media) and, amazingly, ended up with clients like IBM, Red Hat, and Autodesk.

I also [write fiction](/fiction), mostly short stories, although I'm at work on a novel about light pollution,
constellations, and forgetting.
