I'm a writer living in Tucson, Arizona with my wife and two daughters.

My short stories have been featured in _No Tokens_, _West Branch_, _Puerto del Sol_, _Booth: A Journal_, _The Adroit
Journal_, _The Masters Review_, _Caketrain_, and others. My work has been nominated for the Pushcart Prize and Best of
the Net, and was the recipient of the University of Arizona Foundation Award. I received my MFA in creative writing from
the University of Arizona.

I'm currently working on a novel about constellations, light pollution, and where things go when they're truly
forgotten.

I'm a full-time freelance copywriter &amp; content designer. Since 2016, I've done this work under the
[Nurse](https://nurse.media) moniker, and I'm proud to have worked with some big tech/software/IT clients like IBM, Red
Hat, and Autodesk.

I also worked as a director of technical and educational content at Netdata, an infrastructure monitoring startup, from
2019 to 2021. I migrated 400+ pages to a modern, MDX-powered platform (Docusaurus), expanded documentation for new
feature releases, and designed the educational journey through the tool's many sophisticated components. See more at
[learn.netdata.cloud](https://learn.netdata.cloud).

&#10031;

I have a lot of other hobbies and interests, like mountain biking, running, guitar, web development, creating adventures
for my children, web development, React/MDX, calisthenics, gardening, and walking around in my backyard barefoot. I'll
certainly [write about](/articles/) each of them someday.
