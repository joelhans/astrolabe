I'm a writer living in Tucson, Arizona with my wife and two daughters.

My short stories have been featured in _No Tokens_, _West Branch_, _Puerto del Sol_, _Booth: A Journal_, _The Adroit
Journal_, _The Masters Review_, _Caketrain_, and others. My work has been nominated for the Pushcart Prize and Best of
the Net, and was the recipient of the University of Arizona Foundation Award. I received my MFA in creative writing from
the University of Arizona.

I'm currently working on a novel about constellations, light pollution, and where things go when they're truly
forgotten.

Professionally, I'm currently most interested in improving the experience of authoring for and publishing on the web
using tools like React and MDX.

As a copywriter and technical writer, I've run a consultancy called [Nurse Media](https://nurse.media) since
2016. I'm proud to have created content and talked strategy with tech/software clients like IBM, Red Hat, and Autodesk.

I also worked as a director of technical and educational content at Netdata, an infrastructure monitoring startup, from
2019 to 2021. I migrated 400+ pages to a modern, MDX-powered platform (Docusaurus), expanded documentation for new
feature releases, and designed the educational journey through the tool's many sophisticated components. See more at
