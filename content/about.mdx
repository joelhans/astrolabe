**For fun, I write fiction and other oddities in prose.**

Some of those works have been featured in _West Branch_, _No Tokens_, _Puerto del Sol_, _Booth: A Journal_, _The Adroit
Journal_, _The Masters Review_, _Caketrain_, and others. I maintain a [list](/fiction) of all these publications if
you'd like to take a look.

I received my MFA in creative writing from the University of Arizona in 2016 and served as the prose &amp; managing
editor of [*Fairy Tale Review*](https://fairytalereview.com) from 2014 to 2018.

I'm currently working on a novel about mythology, fatherhood, constellations, light pollution, and the lengths to which
we might go to rewrite our own stories.

My work was listed as an honorable mention in the *Caketrain* Competition and the Madeline P. Plonsker Emerging Writers
Residency Prize judged by Brian Evenson, nominated for the Pushcart Prize and Best of the Net, and the recipient of the
University of Arizona Foundation Award.

**I'm also a copywriter and strategic consultant for tech companies through my business, [Commit
Copy](https://commitcopy.com).** Hop over there to learn more about my philosophy, capabilities, and details on starting
an engagement.

I started copywriting back in 2016 after receiving my MFA from the University of Arizona, pulling together some
fantastic clients like IBM, Red Hat, and Autodesk to focus on high-value assets, like technical white papers and email
campaigns.

In 2019, I was recruited to lead technical marketing, documentation, and developer education at Netdata, a startup
building more democratic infrastructure monitoring software. I stayed there for two years before returning to consulting
to fine-tune my work-life and strategy-implementation balances.

Since returning to copywriting and consulting under Commit Copy, I've expanded into open-source clients like the Cloud
Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and Kubeshop (Monokle, Testkube), along with various Web3 projects like Urbit and
Radicle.

**Writing isn't my only interest.**

I spend as much time as I can with my daughters, mountain bike, play guitar, do calisthenics, and walk around my
backyard barefoot. There's also running, web development, knowledge graphs, gardening, and a few other
interests&mdash;hopefully [write about](/articles/) each of them someday.
