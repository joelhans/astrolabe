At _Astrolabe_, we&rsquo;re looking for work about how we seek out, discover, and grasp onto connection. Into the woods.
Across a line. Beneath the ocean. Along a seam. Into the branches of an alternate present or the crevasse of an
alternate future. Across the rifts between one another.

And then, once we find one other, the myths we make.

We&rsquo;re excited to see as many interpretations of this broad theme as there are stars in the night sky.

We&rsquo;re open to work of all genres, with a particular fondness for anything that moves beyond realism in form or
content or spirit.

Read [about *Astrolabe*](/about) for details on our mission and what we&rsquo;re doing with the Universe.

## The details

*Astrolabe* is open for submissions year-round. We pay a **$50 honorarium** upon publication of one or more pieces from
your submission.

To help fund those payments, we alternate between free and paid submission periods throughout the year. Our free periods
begin the day we publish new work&mdash;on the spring equinox, summer solstice, autumnal equinox, and winter
solstice&mdash;and stay open for a month.

> We&rsquo;re temporarily closing for all submissions beginning on December 21, 2023 to help us catch up with the queue and spend time with our families. We'll re-open to free submissions on March 20, 2024.

Here are the free periods for 2024:

- March 20th to April 20th
- June 20st to July 20st
- September 22nd to October 22nd
- December 21st to Jan 21, 2025

Some additional details:

- We currently accept three types of work: **fiction, creative nonfiction, and photography &amp; art**. See below for
  genre-specific instructions. We&rsquo;re not a market for lineated poetry at the moment.
- **We do accept simultaneous submissions**, but please let us know if your work was accepted for publication
  elsewhere—we&rsquo;ll be thrilled for your good news!
- **No multiple submissions**—and if we don&rsquo;t accept your work, please wait until our next submission period
  before trying again unless we specifically ask for more work.
- We consider only **unpublished work**.

We ask for first North American serial rights and non-exclusive print/anthology rights. All copyrights remain yours.
Read more about the [rights we ask for](#your-rights).

## Fiction & creative nonfiction

Send us **up to three** pieces, of _no more than 3,000 words in total_, in `.doc`, `.docx`, or `.pdf` format.

We&rsquo;ll happily consider fiction and CNF in all prose forms&mdash;prose poetry, micro, flash, and beyond&mdash;but
we&rsquo;re not considering lineated poetry at the moment.

## Photography &amp; art

Send us **up to five** pieces in `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.pdf` format. 

If your artwork doesn&rsquo;t work in one of those formats—for example, if you&rsquo;ve built something dynamic or
interactive—send a link to where we can view it online, or just ask!

## Your rights

Astrolabe asks for **first North American serial rights** (FNASR) to your work, which ensures that we&rsquo;re the first
place this work appears. Once your work is published on Astrolabe, all electronic and print rights revert back to
you—you can republish the piece as you see fit. We also ask for **non-exclusive anthology and print rights**. This
allows us to use your work in a possible future anthology, but doesn&rsquo;t prevent you from pursuing other anthology
or print opportunities in the meantime.

The copyright to your work remains yours at all times.
