At _Astrolabe_, we&rsquo;re looking for work about how we seek out, discover, and grasp onto connection. Into the woods.
Across a line. Beneath the ocean. Along a seam. Into the branches of an alternate present or the crevasse of an
alternate future. Across the rifts between one another.

And then, once we find one other, the myths we make.

We&rsquo;re excited to see as many interpretations of this broad theme as there are stars in the night sky.

We&rsquo;re open to work of all genres, with a particular fondness for anything that moves beyond realism in form or
content or spirit.

Read [about *Astrolabe*](/about) for details on our mission and what we&rsquo;re doing with the Universe.

We are open for submissions year-round.

To help pay contributors and defer costs, we alternate between free and paid submission periods throughout the year. We
plan on having at least 4 free submission periods per year of at least a month each&mdash;in the future, we&rsquo;ll try
to publish a calendar.

Some additional details:

- We pay a **$50 honorarium** upon publication of one or more pieces from your submission.
- We currently accept three types of work: **fiction, creative nonfiction, and photography &amp; art**. See below for
  genre-specific instructions. We&rsquo;re not a market for lineated poetry at the moment.
- **We do accept simultaneous submissions**, but please let us know if your work was accepted for publication
  elsewhere—we&rsquo;ll be thrilled for your good news!
- **No multiple submissions**—and if we don&rsquo;t accept your work, please wait until our next submission period
  before trying again.
- We consider only **unpublished work**.

We ask for first North American serial rights and non-exclusive print/anthology rights. All copyrights remain yours.
Read more about the [rights we ask for](#your-rights).

## Fiction & creative nonfiction

Send us **up to three** pieces, of _no more than 3,000 words in total_, in `.doc`, `.docx`, or `.pdf` format.

We&rsquo;ll happily consider fiction and CNF in all prose forms&mdash;prose poetry, micro, flash, and beyond&mdash;but
we&rsquo;re not considering lineated poetry at the moment.

## Photography &amp; art

Send us **up to five** pieces in `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.pdf` format. 

If your artwork doesn&rsquo;t work in one of those formats—for example, if you&rsquo;ve built something dynamic or
interactive—send a link to where we can view it online, or just ask!

## Time to submit!

<Guidelines paid={true} />

## Your rights

Astrolabe asks for **first North American serial rights** (FNASR) to your work, which ensures that we&rsquo;re the first
place this work appears. Once your work is published on Astrolabe, all electronic and print rights revert back to
you—you can republish the piece as you see fit. We also ask for **non-exclusive anthology and print rights**. This
allows us to use your work in a possible future anthology, but doesn&rsquo;t prevent you from pursuing other anthology
or print opportunities in the meantime.

The copyright to your work remains yours at all times.
