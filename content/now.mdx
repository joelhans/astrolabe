title: "What I'm doing now"

## July 2022

I'm on a monthlong sabbatical. It was meant to be a month to dedicate to my novel&mdash;which, despite my entry from way
back in January, is indeed *not* "done"&mdash;but it's transitioned into a period of recovery.

TMI, but it's your fault for being here and reading this: I'm recovering from a single radical inguinal orchiectomy as
part of a potential diagnosis of testicular cancer. I won't know for sure until a pathologist is able to run additional
tests on the testicle that was removed, which means I'm now (as of July 1) in another waiting period. There's a chance
the pathology reports come back negative, and we removed non-cancerous tissue that was causing me discomfort for months,
which is still a win-win.

Depending on the diagnosis, my life will take a simpler or more complex path in the next few months. But, for now, I'm
renewing my focus on what matters: recovering, spending time with family, writing, planning for the future.

I'm extremely grateful and lucky to have the resources I need to take this time. Part of my work this month is
recognizing and thinking about this country's toxic healthcare system, particularly toward those who are under- or
un-insured, and the privilege I have in being able to take an entire month off work without too much impact to my
family's financial situation.

## January 2022

My novel, _The Commission of Dark_, is "done." As done as I can make it myself. I started this project more than 4 years
ago, just before the birth of my first daughter, and I've never been more proud of anything I've worked on creatively.
At this point, I'm working on a query letter to send to literary agents with the hopes of finding a new advocate for my
work and (maybe more importantly) some external feedback on this thing I've spent an absurd amount of time working on in
isolation.

Here's the bulk of the query so far (as of Jan 10):

> In a future fraught with light pollution, where every night sky is as starless as the one above Times Square, a
> middle-aged man named Pilot works on a growing team of decommissioners to rid humanity of its memories of everything
> we’ve lost. iPhones and despots, industrial toxins and whole constellations. 
>
> But when the decommission’s founder feels called to answer an insidious question—has he built something good or
> monstrous?—Pilot finds himself transported to a world built from everything we’ve forgotten—including Ette, his own
> stargazing daughter. With allies in both worlds, including Ette’s old best friend, a marauder of streetlights and
> well-lit stadiums, and a prodigious intern bent on undermining the decommission from the inside, Pilot endeavors to
> save what remains of the daughter he lost by ushering in a new era of dark. 
>
> *The Commission of Dark* reads like the constellation formed by Susanna Clark’s *Piranesi*, Matt Bell’s *Appleseed*,
> and Alix E. Harrow’s *The Ten Thousand Doors of January* as it explores the nature of myths—including those created in
> fatherhood, diaspora, or found families—and the lengths to which we might go to rewrite our own stories. 

I've queried a few agents so far, and now comes the waiting game.

Of course, I'm also continuing to build [Commit Copy](https://commitcopy.com). The last few weeks before the holidays
were super productive, with lots of good chats with potential new clients that are exactly the kind of people I want to
work with, and now I'm waiting for a lot of new projects to sign on the dotted line. If everything works out the way I
hope, it'll be a huge burden off my back to help me focus more on writing (like the novel) in 2022.

Oh! I got some professional photos taken of me for the first time ever. Very exciting stuff. I'm hoping they'll do
double-duty as an official-looking author photo for my personal/creative projects *and* something business-y for my
freelance work. I need to review the gallery and tell the photographer what pictures I want to go with, but I've been
putting it off, mostly because I'm afraid of my own face.

Reading Susanna Clarke's _Piranesi_ and E. Lily Wu's _On Fragile Waves_.

I just finished a new-to-me novel by a dear friend and I'm so hopeful for its future.

## December 2021

Whew!

I've been up to quite a bit since my last update.

In November, I launched a new copywriting business focused on open-source companies &amp; startups&mdash;[**Commit
Copy**](https://commitcopy.com)&mdash;after stumbling across the idea at the beginning of the month. I was working
through a "challenge" organized by [The Copywriter Club](https://thecopywriterclub.com/), and was focused on defining my
niche, when I realized that my experience in open source is one of my unique differentiators as a copywriter. I
understand the unique challenges these businesses face, and I've worked in every facet of marketing them: web copy,
content marketing, email, documentation, community, and so on.

No more Nurse Media! I'm pretty excited to move beyond the name, which wasn't as valuable as I'd once thought it could
be. While the whole _nurse tree_ thing was fun, it didn't really mesh that well with the type of copywriting business I
wanted to run in 2021 and beyond. 

I wonder if I should change the name of my LLC to something other than _Nurse Media_ now...

Both my daughters caught COVID at the beginning of November, the younger having picked it up from daycare, but
fortunately they're both just fine. I can't recommend taking care of two toddlers while trying to launch a new venture,
but the work got done eventually.

Still working on that novel. Almost done. Agents beware...

Reading Lincoln Michel's _The Body Scout_.

## August 2021

We're in the middle of a pretty phenomenal monsoon here in Tucson, Arizona—this July was the single wettest month on
record—so the desert is particularly green and lush. I've been enjoying that as much as time allows, mountain biking and
running and frog-hunting and taking pictures of old plants with new growth.

My younger daughter turned 1 in the end of July. She's walking now, reminding me of just how far you can go even when
your steps are short, and you fall often.

Working on the fourth draft of my novel, _The Commission of Dark_, in my fourth year of working on it. Both the most
grueling draft and year yet.

I'm in the process of rebuilding my copywriting and copy consultancy, [Nurse Media](https://nurse.media), after taking a
two-year break to work full-time at an infrastructure monitoring startup. I'm excited to apply everything I learned—the
intersection between documentation, technical writing, and educational products—to some new efforts for both myself and
others.

Speaking of which, I'm beginning to dig into a much larger project around how writing on the web could be a hell of a
lot better, and that maybe [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is the future I've been waiting for. I'm starting to see the
closing of a loop that began 10 years ago, all about how writers can be more productive, creative, and influential when
writing for the web. More on this soon.

Reading Brian Evenson's _Song for the Unraveling of the World_.
