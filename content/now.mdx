In love with the idea of having a [/now page](https://nownownow.com/), so here's my version.

## August 2021

We're in the middle of a pretty phenomenal monsoon here in Tucson, Arizona—this July was the single wettest month on record—so the desert is particularly green and lush. I've been enjoying that as much as time allows, mountain biking and running and frog-hunting and taking pictures of old plants with new growth.

My younger daughter turned 1 in the end of July. She's walking now, reminding me of just how far you can go even when your steps are short, and you fall often.

Working on the fourth draft of my novel, _The Commission of Dark_, in my fourth year of working on it. Both the most grueling draft and year yet.

I'm in the process of rebuilding my copywriting and copy consultancy, [Nurse Media](https://nurse.media), after taking a two-year break to work full-time at an infrastructure monitoring startup. I'm excited to apply everything I learned—the intersection between documentation, technical writing, and educational products—to some new efforts for both myself and others.

Speaking of which, I'm beginning to dig into a much larger project around how writing on the web could be a hell of a lot better, and that maybe [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is the future I've been waiting for. I'm starting to see the closing of a loop that began 10 years ago, all about how writers can be more productive, creative, and influential when writing for the web. More on this soon.

Reading Brian Evenson's _Song for the Unraveling of the World_.
