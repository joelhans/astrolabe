I helped the founder of this Detroit, Mich.-based SaaS startup **identify the real value of his product**, then crafted copywriting that resonates with the pains of the target audience&mdash;PR professionals who want to create impeccable
experiences for the journalists they're pitching&mdash;to inspire sign-ups from high-value prospects.

I worked with the IBM Streams external relations, product, and engineering teams to identify key value propositions and **produce technical content for CTOs and data science professionals**. We even got their biggest customer, Verizon, to cough up details on how they use streaming analytics to make call centers more enjoyable.

I was a director-level technical writer and copywriter for this infrastructure monitoring startup between 2019 and 2021.
My primary responsibility was the strategy and execution of technical content designed to **attract an ideal audience of
DevOps engineers and turn them into champions of Netdata's solution** by making them incredibly successful at their job. I produced hundreds of pieces of documentation, blog content, product copywriting, and more.

As the first marketing hire for SSD Nodes, I played an integral role in their copywriting and content strategy between

year-over-year sales on Black Friday with an impactful landing page** that translated technical jargon into _I need that
