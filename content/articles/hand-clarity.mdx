Last week, I fractured the 5th metacarpal bone in my left hand, a common break that's colloquially known as a [boxer's fracture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer's_fracture).

<Statement>In simpler words: I broke my hand while mountain biking.</Statement>

Now that my hand is cast and not very graceful, it's hard to type at anything near the speed and agility I'd like. I've had a week of practice on how to adapt to not being able to use my ring or pinky fingers, but it's still slow-going and sometimes quite uncomfortable. My wrist bones press against the cast uncomfortably, and my entire hand sometimes cramps from being put in awkward positions.

I'm fortunate that I broke my non-dominant hand this time. Last time I did this, I broke my right hand, which made everything, especially moving a mouse, way harder than I had expected.

<Statement>To be clear: Breaking a hand sucks.</Statement>

But this setback, a minor one in the grand scheme of things, got me thinking about efficiency and clarity. I started to replace my usual longwinded email writing style with a shorter, more curt variety. No more than two paragraphs and straight to the point. I often included a call-to-action in bold or italics to help drive my point home and found I was getting more consistent, on-point responses.

<Statement>The question: How would I write this if I couldn't write as fast or well as I do now?</Statement>

Ask yourself this question if a piece of writing, no matter the purpose, starts to drift or lose steam. If the answer is different than what you're currently writing, start over and head in the [new, efficient direction](/articles/copywriting-checklist/).

You can always make your writing more flowery later.

For now, try to get straight to the point.

<Statement>The lesson: Use simple words, and as few as possible, placed as logically as possible.</Statement>
