Here's the documentation on how to reverse the direction of this stupid Hampton Bay fan.

With this stupid remote.

Notice that there is no reverse button. There is also no reverse switch on the fan itself. Either of these would have
solved the problem right away, but they do not exist.

## Prerequisites

To perform the reversal process, you'll need a tiny Philips-head screwdriver.

## Open up the remote

To begin, remove the battery cover and the battery.

Remove the tiny screw from beneath the battery compartment.

Danerougly pry open the remote with a paring knife to reveal the circuit board. Next, slide the battery back into the
little conductive bits, which are now just sort of hanging out. No one is really sure if this process works when the fan
is turned off, so go make sure the switch it turned on, then push one of the three speed buttons.

## Send a reverse signal

Take your screwdriver and press it to these two points. Right here. Like this.

You should hear a "click" inside your fan. That's it responding to the `reverse` signal.

You know, the one that your fan was seemingly unable to do. You know, because of the lack of button on the remote and
the lack of switch on the fan.

Your fan should now be turning the right way. Or the left way, depending on what it was going in the first place. Either
way, you should be happy.

## Troubleshooting

Oh, you're not happy? You want to understand _why_?

Okay.

Remove these two screws, on the top-right and bottom-left corners of the circuit board.

Remove the circuit board from the case. Note that the rubber piece has a fifth hole in it, but there's no button
attached to the circuit board there.

Interesting.

Remove the rubber piece and take a closer look at the circuit board where that empty hole is.

Surprise! There's the reverse! We decided to sell a remote that _does_ have reverse logic, and _can_ send a reverse
signal to the fan, and the fan _will_ respond that reverse signal, but we **actively chose to remove the button**. We
just assumed that if there's no button, there's no way for the fan to get reversed in the first place. No feature, no
problem.

Sorry?
