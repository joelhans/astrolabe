Give yourself some motivation to get started on a new project by buying it a domain name.

Why does it work? My best guess is that buying a domain name is a **fast, risk-free, and relatively inexpensive way to
commit to your vision**. It's staking down a _coming soon_ sign down on what'll become this project's face to the world.

Buying a domain name is a lot easier now than it used to be, thanks to all the non-`.com` domains. Many of them cost
about $10/year, which is less expensive than pretty much any other part of building or sharing a project.

The last time I embarked on a truly new project was in 2016, when I had graduated from the University of Arizona with an
MFA in creative writing. I couldn't find good work locally, and quickly tired of freelancing as a technical writer on
Upwork.

I needed to make a transition from _freelancer_ to _consultant_. The differences are vague, yes, but I felt like the
best way to present myself as the owner of a professional writing consultancy was to roll out a website.

I spent a full week agonizing over my future business' name. I had a whiteboard overrun with options, derivates,
failures.

The way I committed was buying [`nurse.media`](https://nurse.media).

I still needed months to figure out _what kind of consultant I wanted to be_, transfer that into some copy, and build
the website for it. But without the name—the domain name—I was never going to get there.

**Yesterday, I bought domain name: `present.games`.**

There's nothing there yet. I don't even know if I _like_ the name, much less love it.

But I already wrote a 500-word manifesto about the kind of project I want to build. Who I want to help, why that matters
to me so much. I'm already begging friends to give me feedback.

If you've been hesitating on jumping in: **Buy the domain name already**.

You'll find yourself committed in a new, exciting way. It's freeing. It'll be scary, but a different kind of scary. Less
worrying about what the heck your building and more dreaming up what you should work on first.

Which should be [sending me an email](mailto:j@joelhans.com) and telling me all about the domain you just bought.
