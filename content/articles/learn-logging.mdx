I'm big on journals. The [morning pages exercise](/articles/how-to-start-writing) has undoubtedly saved my writing on
multiple occasions. When I'm having trouble working my way through an incomprehensibly large problem, I write about it
until I have what I've dubbed, somewhat uncreatively, a **big thought**. I've taken extensive notes on books and
articles, outlined novels, and rambled through thousands of words on my daily happenings, from breaking bones to having
children to mountain bike rides.

I've journaled on paper, then in Obsidian, then in Notion, then in [Athens](/articles/get-started-athens), and back to
Obsidian again. But we're not talking about technology here.

We're talking about the value in note-taking.

If you ever have the (dis)pleasure of participating in a creative writing workshop, there will come a time when you're
up for critique. That means everyone else in the group has read your work and conjured up some empathetic, constructive
feedback for you. And now they'll all offer that feedback in what feels like the longest conversation in your life.
You'll nod your head and scribble down some notes with a shaking hand. You'll leave that room with a ten-pound stack of
papers all decorated with line edits and question marks, plus critique letters that detail exactly why your work is
terrible.

In that post-critique malaise, you'll probably hear yet one more piece of feedback:

> Go home and read through the critique letters, then put everything into a drawer. Never look at them again. Wait a
> week. Sit down in front of a piece of paper and think about the feedback you received. Write down the constructive,
> valuable feedback that you remember. That's the critique that counts.

I know I did that a few times in undergrad. Even more so in grad school.

The point of this advice&mdash;to give you brain space to distill, excise, and reorganize a mess of
information&mdash;applies in journaling, too.

Or note-taking.

Stop forgetting what you learned.

Take notes about your daily learnings, no matter how small, in a way that's easily searchable later.

Don't edit yourself, and record what you learn as they happen, not at the end of the day, and not at the end of a quarterâ€”you've forgotten by then.

I use Obsidian, a free tool for managing knowledge (and a whole lot more!) for exactly this purpose. At the end of every daily note, I have a section titled, *What I #learned today*. I flesh out this list every time I surprise myself with something now.

And now, I can search Obsidian for "#learned" and rediscover dozens of personal insights about freelancing, copywriting, or everything else that's called life.

Try it!

It's an easily achievable superpower.

Great for brainstorming content, improving your processes, or just giving yourself a quick reminder of your wins.
