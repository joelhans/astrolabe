Stop forgetting what you learned.

Take notes about your daily learnings, no matter how small, in a way that's easily searchable later.

Don't edit yourself, and record what you learn as they happen, not at the end of the day, and not at the end of a quarterâ€”you've forgotten by then.

I use Obsidian, a free tool for managing knowledge (and a whole lot more!) for exactly this purpose. At the end of every daily note, I have a section titled, *What I #learned today*. I flesh out this list every time I surprise myself with something now.

And now, I can search Obsidian for "#learned" and rediscover dozens of personal insights about freelancing, copywriting, or everything else that's called life.

Try it!

It's an easily achievable superpower.

Great for brainstorming content, improving your processes, or just giving yourself a quick reminder of your wins.
