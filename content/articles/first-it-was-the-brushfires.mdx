2017 was the last year I regularly submitted work to literary magazines before the _Great Novel Writing of 2017-2021_.
Heck, the last year I regularly wrote short fiction until the very tail end of 2021.

_Puerto del Sol_ was the last magazine to accept a story of mine, which means it's phenomenally special to see it
republished online via their archives project, _Puerto Del Pasado_. I'm really grateful to Emily Radell, who works with
_Puerto del Sol_ on this project, for being persistent in ushering my story through to its new home.

Such a phenomenal feeling to have someone recognize and champion my work once again.
