<p className="text-sm italic p-4 bg-sea bg-opacity-5 rounded-sm">Some context: Back in March 2021, I crossed paths with a woman who sat on the curb and let my dog, who was then a puppy no longer than my forearm, flail with joy all over her lap. Unprompted, In the middle of a ten-minute conversation, she told me I should be a writer. "I am a writer!" I said. She said, "Then write more. Write to your children." So, on occasion, I write letters to my daughters and publish them here.</p>

<p className="text-2xl lg:text-3xl lg:leading-10" style={{fontFamily: 'Arapey, serif'}}>We went mountain biking. We went to a new place, on a new route, down new roads. The eleven o&rsquo;clock sun already desaturating the concrete. We pillaged sidewalks and tried to avoid the sprawling goatheads at their yellow-flowered warnings. We crossed a major arterial without hitting the walk sign. We counted the ground squirrels that intersected the bike path, always from left to right, as though they could only find safety in the north. All along the way, over the sound of the wind and the tires beneath us, you kept shouting, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been here before!&rdquo; Yes. That&rsquo;s what I said each time. <em>Yes</em>. You figured it out. It's not about exploring, it&rsquo;s not about bravery or a destination, but rather that you have gone to an unrecognizable place and still recognize yourself.</p>
